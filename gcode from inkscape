STEPS TO GET GCODE FROM INKSCAPE
Imported image to g-code:
1.	Launch Inkscape, go to file -> import -> select your image( jpeg/png) -> open
2.	A Dialogue box (jpeg bitmap image import) appear -> click OK (with default setting). (this step is not needed if you are creating the drawing on inkscape itself) 
3.	Click the lock icon on the top  
4.	Adjust the size of image, go to layer-> add layer -> add
5.	Right click on the image and select move to layer-> select the layer-> move.
6.	 Select the image go to, path -> trace bitmap (shift+alt+B)
7.	Trace bitmap dialogue box appears-> click update -> tick live preview box -> adjust brightness threshold â€“> click OK 
8.	The vector image forms a layer over jpeg image
9.	Remove the vector layer by dragging it and delete the jpeg image(right click)
10.	Select object(vector image), Path->object to path
11.	Path -> dynamic offset
12.	Extensions->Gcodetools-> tools library -> select tool ->apply
13.	Green box appears, we can change the parameters in the box by choosing text icon and typing over the required parameter
14.	Select object -> extensions -> Gcodetools->orientation points -> apply
15.	Select object ->extensions->Gcodetools->path to gcode->prefferences (change file name and directory if needed) -> select path to gcode tab and click apply
16.	The object would now look a bit distorted, your Gcode has been created in the choice of directory you had entered in step 15 in preference.

Text to g-code
1.	File -> document properties -> select the parameters of your work base
2.	Layer->add layer -> ok
3.	Select text icon and type the text to be converted to gcode
4.	Right click on the object(text)-> move to layer -> select the layer to move the object to
5.	Select object, Path ->object to path
6.	Path -> dynamic offset
7.	Extensions -> gcodetools -> tool library->select tool-> apply
8.	Extensions -> gcode tools-> orientation points->apply
9.	Extensions->gcode tools-> path to gcode-> edit preferences-> select path to gcode tab-> apply
10.	Gcode created in the selected directory

Image and text to Gcode
1.	Import the image and type the text as in above methods
2.	Select both the objects (shift + select) -> object -> group
3.	Follow the above steps
4.	Layer->path(object to path, dynamic offset)->extensions -> gcode tools (tool library, orientation points, path to gcode)
